# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How is my data stored?
All your research data is stored locally on your device using a secure SQLite database. No data is sent to external servers unless you use online literature search or AI features.

## Do I need API keys for all features?
No. Many features work out of the box, but to use certain AI agents or premium literature retrievers, you may need to provide your own API keys in the Settings panel.

## Can I use Research Wizard offline?
Yes! Most features, including project management and local literature organization, work offline. Online search and AI features require an internet connection.

## How do I export my research reports?
You can export reports in Markdown, DOCX, or PDF formats from the report view in the Writing section.

## Can I customize the report structure?
Yes. Go to Settings > Report Parameters to adjust the structure, language, and other options for generated reports.

## How do I add a new AI agent or literature retriever?
Developers can extend the app by adding new modules in the backend and registering them in the settings. See the Developer Guide for details.

## Where can I get more help?
Check the [official documentation](../intro.md) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/alaaet/research_wizard).
