# Supported Retrievers

Research Wizard aims to support integration with various document and data retrievers to enhance your research workflow.

## Current Status
Currently, Research Wizard does not include built-in retriever integrations. This is a planned feature for future versions.

## Planned Retriever Support
- **Local file search and indexing**
- **Integration with academic databases (e.g., arXiv, PubMed)**
- **Web page and PDF importers**
- **Custom retriever plugins**

These features will allow you to:
- Quickly find and import relevant research materials
- Organize and link resources to your projects
- Expand the capabilities of Research Wizard as your needs grow

Stay tuned for future updates!
