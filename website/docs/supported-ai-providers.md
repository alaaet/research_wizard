# Supported AI Providers

Research Wizard is designed with extensibility in mind, including future integration with AI-powered research assistants and tools.

## Current Status
At present, Research Wizard does not include built-in AI provider integrations. However, support for AI providers is a planned feature for future releases.

## Planned AI Provider Support
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.)**
- **Anthropic (Claude)**
- **Google Gemini**
- **Local LLMs (via API or plugin)**

These integrations will enable features such as:
- Automated research question generation
- Summarization of research materials
- Intelligent project suggestions

Stay tuned for updates as these features are developed!
